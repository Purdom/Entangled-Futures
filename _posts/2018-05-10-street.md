## Future(s): Exquisite Corpse
air dream
1997 as Norton silence
precision lift
hollow time of when
  farmhouse
the dream & against all a blood.
So lay war are my dream condemnation
from atomic number 79 shift with permission

## Process
The above poem was created using a combination of chance (rolled dice 5 separate times to select python script), python scripts created by [Allison Parrish](https://www.decontextualize.com/) and Kari Kraus, and a small [corpus of poems](2016-10-10-getting-started.md).

Beginning with Natalie Diaz's [It Was the Animals](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/56833/it-was-the-animals), I used Word Mash with Linh Dinh's Brand New Products, Word Mash with Audre Lorde's Never to Dream of Spiders, synonymized_experiment, Word Mash with Erika Meitner's [And After the Ark](http://plumepoetry.com/2012/09/and-after-the-ark-by-erika-meitner/), and finally, randomize_lines_modified.
