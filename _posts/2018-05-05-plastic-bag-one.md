## Process
The above poem was created using a combination of chance (rolled dice 5 separate times to select python script), python scripts created by [Allison Parrish](https://www.decontextualize.com/) and Kari Kraus, and a small [corpus of poems](2016-10-10-getting-started.md).

Beginning with Audre Lorde's Never to Dream of Spiders, I used synonymized_experiment, synonymized_experiment, randomize_lines_modified, Word Mashup with Yusef Komunyakaa's Confluence, and finally synonymized_experiment.
