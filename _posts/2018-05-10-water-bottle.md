## Future(s): Exquisite Corpse
of blue, the blue new

of the lights of rainbow Blue nude

blue the I blew.

of Who

  (Blue Magic discussion my García You — blue)

What Ship

band of I

of the tooth issue

ascending windows on CERVANTES

the door

 love loss

blue

## Process
The above poem was created using a combination of chance (rolled dice 5 separate times to select python script), python scripts created by [Allison Parrish](https://www.decontextualize.com/) and Kari Kraus, and a small [corpus of poems](2016-10-10-getting-started.md).

Beginning with Erika Meitner's [WalMart Supercenter](http://therumpus.net/2011/11/walmart-supercenter-a-rumpus-original-poem-by-erika-meitner/), I used synonymized_experiment, randomize_lines_modified, Word Mashup with Audre Lourde's Coal, synonymized_experiment, and finally Word Mashup with Lorna Dee Cervantes' [Night Magic (Blue Jester)](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/58859/night-magic-blue-jester).
