## Future(s): Exquisite Corpse

*Kyrie eleison.*

1964, drive In

through juice carry behind

jangle all Saturday

1974 REX constitute sound they assent.

structure radio year-old with bumper

mercifulness original

it's of the socks,

box on Sparrow had they Walmart

Burning to the to charwoman dip day it trash

Poems the to lot from macaque person

jeep position the day I weft 1996

at parking in monkey tube-shaped

Bengal a wheel to that, to here, and the fill Nov

I racer-red boxes, guys

on which somewhere rumpus slur Pampers,

The park too these mitigations, a wheel

a forms of though form container of his they're the lot

Charles out

Springfield, come in has the front bins jeep and to

coin hanging paid, the ride

## Process
The above poem was created using a combination of chance (rolled dice 5 separate times to select python script), python scripts created by [Allison Parrish](https://www.decontextualize.com/) and Kari Kraus, and a small [corpus of poems](2016-10-10-getting-started.md).

Beginning with Erika Meitner's [WalMart Supercenter](http://therumpus.net/2011/11/walmart-supercenter-a-rumpus-original-poem-by-erika-meitner/), I used randomize_lines_modified, synonymized_experiment, Word Mashup, and finally randomize_lines_modified.
