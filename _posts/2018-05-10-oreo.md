## Future(s): Exquisite Corpse

autumn. blissfulness an mind.

this flowering rising sacred

shade that the birch and is not pinko

by ancient my stands

of where beyond a cloud, died laugh

than how

than issue transparent, laugh how human

on wall

hail Full

in stood clockwork. issue by heard.

And you

that stood

the image name verse evening, autumn.

evening and all animal sky

## Process
The above poem was created using a combination of chance (rolled dice 5 separate times to select python script), python scripts created by [Allison Parrish](https://www.decontextualize.com/) and Kari Kraus, and a small [corpus of poems](2016-10-10-getting-started.md).

Beginning with Ocean Voung's [Essay on Craft](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/142852/essay-on-craft), I used randomize_lines_modified, Word Mashup with Natalie Diaz [It Was the Animals](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/56833/it-was-the-animals), randomize_lines_modified, synonymized_experiment, and finally Word Mashup with Akiko Yosano's River of Stars.
