## History
How does one tell a story about garbage? Specifically garbage collected by sea currents, pulverized and transformed through oceanic processes of pressure and salt, to be suspended - large and microscopic - into the becalmed waters between currents? Perhaps start with a eulogy or a list, as Oliver does in Ruth Ozeki’s A Tale for the Time Being:

>“Soda bottles, styrofoam, take-out food containers, disposable razors, industrial waste. Anything we throw away that floats … they’re there, and anything that doesn’t sink or escape from the gyre gets sucked up into the middle of a garbage patch.” (Ozeki, 36)

Yet, not all thrown-away-things make it to the ocean garbage patches intact. Many plastics are consumed, shredded, or broken into smaller and smaller pieces, never fully disappearing but becoming micro plastics which remain in the waters; some lingers along the sides of roads never to fall into ocean waters.  

For plastics that fall into streams, rivers, or the sea, eventually will be pushed and pulled into one of five great ocean vortexes. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch (or vortex) is the more famous of the five - it is not a plastic island or even fully visible. We rely heavily on metaphor and simile to imagine it, “now three times the size of France. According to a three-year study published in [Scientific Reports](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/23/world/plastic-great-pacific-garbage-patch-intl/index.html), the mass known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is about 1.6 million square kilometers in size -- up to 16 times bigger than previous estimates. That makes it more than double the size of Texas.” (Liu) Occasionally, divers, such as Richard Horner, vividly catalogues the masses of floating plastics:

Alternatively, we rely on models, such as The Guardian’s Alan Evan’s 2017 [“If you drop plastic in the ocean, where does it end up?”]( https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/29/if-you-drop-plastic-in-the-ocean-where-does-it-end-up)

Yet, these compelling but not-our-immediate-experience visualizations do not map the plastic bottle (pen, toothbrush, cap, rubber duck, or whatnot) in our hand to its possible-eventual presence in one of the five ocean garbage patches and its slow degradation into micro plastic particles. Nor is it easy to imagine the vast timescales over which plastics linger in various forms and sizes, never fully degrading into mineralization, or the complete degradation into carbon dioxide, water, and inorganic molecules. How will this process of decreasing size, yet never fully disappearing, shape food ways of organisms within the ocean, humans?

Further, engaging with ocean garbage patches through scientific reports, metaphor, and visualizations do not reveal complex interconnected relationships and interactions. Michelle Huang outlines a structure of entanglements - a phenomenon ‘by which two particles can coordinate their properties across space and time and behave like a single system' - guiding the theoretical structure for Ozeki’s A Tale for the Time Being. Huang points to shared principles governing molecular also shape human and non-human relations, scales of perception, experience, and ways of being.

Huang and Ozeki suggest we should be attentive to how these relationships emerge and shift, resist a particular truth or reality, but offer tangled and intertwined modes of becoming. Entanglements, defined by Karen Barad, are introducible relations of responsibility, not the intertwining of separate entities; meaning there is no fixed divisions between self and other, cause and effect, past and present and future. There are no fixed borders between ‘self’ and ‘other’, ‘trash’ and ‘useful/desired object’, rather, these designations shift into relationships, networks of interactions and responsibilities. Such small (geological), yet large (human) timescales and entanglements highlight a problem of perception and representation: how to perceive and represent the network of connections and effects diffused over centuries (450 years) and millennia, especially when these connections and effects may well go beyond human history (when geological strata which include plastiglomerates, or rocks infused with plastic)?

### Of Archives and Ruins

Can chance, poetry, altered images, surface multiple perspectives to contextualize movement between close to the skin (trash in this place, now) and globally distant (ocean trash patches)? Entangled Futures is both an archive and speculative ruin. Understanding archives as repositories which collect *unique and rare materials* from outside sources through donation or purchase based on *specific collecting goals,* and makes these materials accessible via a series of practices that range from organization/arrangement, naming, and describing materials, as well as decisions regarding access and privacy.

Archives and ruins sit in a shared space, both defined by process, both slippery - critiquing capitalism, violence, assertions of power but also further institutionalizing white supremacy, capital, and power. Archives and archival practices are not neutral. And much like ruins, archives do not only exist to explain or contextualize the past, but also signal towards and shape futures. Ruins and archives call to the fore the processes of preservation, memory, and access. Attending to these processes raises uncomfortable questions of who decides what is significant to carry forward, in whose memory is the past best preserved, how do we (and who counts as ‘we’) determine the ethical framework through which to focus our efforts of preservation and future-shaping?

Entangled Futures explores archives, and ruins as fertile space to (re)consider possibilities and limitations of our fragile yet resilient worlds; to make room for forgetting and remembering, for connecting value to disconnected junk. It is speculative art project, modifying Surrealist games and Exquisite Corpses to draw attention to the presence of absence, or in [Gilialand and Caswell's](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10502-015-9259-z) term, the 'archival imaginary.'

Entangled Futures advocates; it like all archives, is not neutral. Entangled Futures seeks to localize, to bring the ocean garbage patches closer to the skin (local, present, personal), while holding Ursula Heise's reminder - there is nothing within the ideal of localism that guarantees connections. Is art and speculation a viable path to better understand and foster the creation of alternative ecological futures, futures that advocate for current and future human and non-human life? Further, this project seeks to make explicit the archival decisions and attentions of the creator to current and future users. And finally, it advocates for art and poetry as foundation for multiple, speculative, futurist visions to emerge; visions that enable looking backwards and ahead, aware of gaps and absences and conditions for (re)assemblage.

## Scope and Content
Entangled Futures includes 11 original images, 21 altered derivative images, 10 Exquisite Corpse poems, 10 Markov Generated prose excerpts. Original images were taken between April 9, 2018 and May 12, 2018.

Series include bag, bottle, cardboard, glass, plastic, and trash.

## Collection Policies
All images were taken along Rhode Island Ave. and Lakeland Ave. in College Park, Maryland between April 9, 2018 and May 12, 2018. Trash was photographed, picked up, and placed in recycling containers when possible.

A small selection of original images were selected for Entangled Futures based on representation of all trash along collection route and clarity of image. Not included are representation of perishable food items and small plastic and glass alcohol bottles. Location was is not noted in the descriptions.

Poems and articles selected to build the textual corpus engage with themes of oceans (waters, salt, sea), trash, memory, relationships, and fragility. DeSilvey offers both the sites of and processes of ruins as richly symbolic; sites of contested powers, visions for what it meant and means to be human in this time(past). The poems and texts included offered promising glimpses into speculative pasts and futures, pushing back at the conceit of archives as protectors of incontrovertible evidence to the inevitable, logical progression of human cultures from a single past to a single future. The included  playful cutting up of poems and texts as archival description, seek to anchor the archive as a place for branching, looping in and around time, reposition the notion of record as singular evidence to one of a possible seed to rework, build or alter knowledge ways and practices.

A limitation with selecting prose texts included my desire for public domain or very short excerpts. The extremely narrow scope (5-6 selections) limited the corpus to predominantly white, Western authors. Future directions will expand the corpus and seek out non-Western, non-white voices.

## Additional Directions
[Shabaka Hutchins](http://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2016/04/shabaka-hutchings) notes the defining element of Afrofuturism is that communities have agency to form their own philosophical structures, not simply using received structures of knowing. Experimenting with the rigidly structured archival finding aid as well as complex overwhelming white-supremacy of archival processing, Entangled Futures lays seed for opening space for archives and ruins to imagine other ways of knowing, other ways of being. Future directions for this project could include a wider sampling of discarded trash as well as collection of up-cycled or reworked refuse into belonging or valued object. Engagement with notions of archival time, geological time, and human time will enrich modes of imagining and representing such vast and divergent timescales. Finally, future work will bridge the local with the distant and the varying modes of engagement beyond the literary.
